# lets_be_rational
Pure Python implementation of Let's Be Rational by Peter JÃ¤ckel.
This is not as fast as the pure C++ version but avoids using a wrapper.

# Why is it useful?
It is a very fast implementation of the black formula.
There is a version using SWIG out there, but this one is pure python.
So on balance what you lose on speed you gain in portability.
